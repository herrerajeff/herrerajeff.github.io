		Hands for Trump is a project that touches on current socio-political issues in a snarky, but unwavering fashion and serves as a way to donate to charities through protest art that you can wear. Typeset in the fitting Akzidenz-Grotesk BQ Super (yes, we think a lot of the current climate is grotesque), we have designed these pieces to represent your views, while letting others around you know that you are an ally. Let's wear our support.

		The current administration's rhetoric is certainly regression rather than its antonym. Each charity we've curated stands for the progression of the group it represents and mankind. We believe in these causes and their respective purposes. We donated to ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood and the Trans Lifeline.

		What made John stand out to us was his online persona. He is able to remain humorous and snarky while making profound statements and observations about gender, sexuality, and social issues. We wanted to keep focus on the content while showcasing the lighter side of John’s personality, visually juxtaposed with poilitical imagery.
	</p>
	<p>
		The result was a dynamic hub, where visitors could interact with John’s writing and immediately get a sense of his voice and personality.

		To create the balance of personality and content, we made sure to use heavy imagery on the home and work pages, and heavy white space and minimalism on the article pages. This managed the viewer's attention on a contextual basis and balanced the macro and micro user experience.

	<p>
		We built the site on Jekyll, a static site and blog generator and connected it to a backend CMS tailored for static websites keeping everything light and speedy, with attention to the modularity that John needed.
