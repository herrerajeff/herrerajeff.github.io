	Your Screen Is Not Dead is a weekly podcast all about film. Every week the hosts announce a film to watch, then they talk about it.

	<h3 style="color: #{{ page.color }}">Unique Features</h3>
	<p>To further the concept of VHS and film, animations on the website create chromatic aberration and a glitch effect on text, a VHS loading screen, and tracking lines along the bottom of the screen. (above)</p>
	<p>In order to help the hosts feature their episodes on social media posts every week, I created a rollover state with visual flair that could serve as a tool to generate episode promotion. The hosts just need to screenshot and post!</p>

	<p>For the launch, we created a set of buttons and a thank you card. We put a button on each card, and once it was taken off the card, it revealed the QR code for the podcast's website.</p>
