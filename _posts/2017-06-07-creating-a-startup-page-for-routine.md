As a designer, my specific brand of minimalism is more about maximizing efficiency than going against some sort of consumer culture. I believe that striving for efficiency inherently gets rid of all the *extra* in life, but approaching it with the mindset of improving workflow instead of 'sticking it to the man' is more my style. **This brings me to the creation of my startup page.**

<blockquote>
    "But Jeff there's already a bookmark function in every browser, isn't that the same thing?"

    {% include icon-quote.html %}
</blockquote>

Yes and no.

I believe that baked in browser bookmark lists will always be flawed because they introduce UX problems. You either keep your bookmarks in an incredibly crowded toolbar, a 'recent' startup page designed to look cool instead of work efficiently (looking at you Apple), or use an extension like [Raindrop.io](http://www.raindrop.io) (which I personally love, but serves as a catch-all more than something I want to see every time I open a new tab).

So, the solution: **create your own Startup page**. If you're using Safari, you can set a webpage as your homepage and default new tab. However, if you're using Chrome, you'll need to install the [New Tab Direct](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) extension in order for your new tabs to be set to your new Startup page.

Now, go forth and be efficient, my friend. Welcome to the 1-click posse.
